README for 1.1-286-COMPATIBILITY branch of Pluto
This branch holds the development source code that will become the 
JSR-286 (Portlet 2.0) reference implementation. It is anticipated that
this source code will be eventually merged into the SVN trunk to
become Pluto 2.0.

To build a binary distribution with Pluto installed in Tomcat 5.5,
make sure you have Ant 1.6+ and Maven 2.0.4+ installed and run
the dist-build.xml Ant script with the command line:

ant -f dist-build.xml

Upon successful completion of the build, the distribution will be found in the
target/dist directory.

The Ant build uses Maven to build the distribution. Details are found in the
comments on the top of dist-build.xml.
=======
Apach Pluto 2.1 is the second version of the JSR-286 Reference Implementation (Java Portlet API 2.0).
See the Getting Started page on the Pluto web site (http://portals.apache.org/pluto)
for instructions on how to build Pluto from source. 

A simplified way to build a bundled Pluto 2.1 distribution is to use the dist-build.xml Ant build which downloads 
Tomcat and calls the appropriate Maven commands to create a distribution with Pluto embedded in Tomcat. The 
built distribution, which contains this file, when started via the startup script in the bin directory will 
start the Pluto portal by browsing to http://localhost:8080/pluto/portal/ and logging in as pluto/pluto 
(or tomcat/tomcat). See the documentation in dist-build.xml for more details. Also invoke the Help mode on the
Pluto Admin page for instructions on how to use the admin portlet to deploy custom portlets.

This version was based on Pluto 1.1 and was refactored in the 1.1-286-COMPATIBILITY branch to add 
JSR-286 features and create the official JSR-286 RI submitted to the Java Community Process.

The Pluto 2.0 code was subsequently refactored within the 2.0-spi-refactoring branch to make the descriptor
API more flexible and fix other issues. This branch became the new trunk on 11/3/2008.
